        <h1> My Testimonial</h1> 
        <p>ICT training for us as educators is very essential to us on our field of teaching. 
            I am very thankful to our ALS CAI’s most specially to our coordinator sir Gigi for giving us the chance to attain this program. 
            I also very grateful to our instructors every week for giving such time and would do their very best for us to 
            learn on how to use Microsoft Excel, power point, and on how to create and manage our own web page.This training will 
            help us a lot on our profession as educators because I do believe that you cannot give 
            what we don’t have so, for us to enable to share our knowledge we must also be equipped and will trained specially in using computers for now 
            a days.
